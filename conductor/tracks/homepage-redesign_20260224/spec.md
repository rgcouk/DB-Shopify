# Specification: Homepage Redesign (Ingredient & Category Focus)

**Track ID:** homepage-redesign_20260224
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-24
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Redesign the homepage to lead with scientific ingredient benefits (Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, Reishi) and the honey delivery matrix, while providing direct paths to all product categories (Honeys, Tinctures, Gummies) to maximize conversion and brand authority.

## Context

The "Druid and Bear" brand requires a high-fidelity "Lux-Noir" aesthetic that justifies its premium price point. Current homepage needs to shift from generic product listing to benefit-driven storytelling.

## User Story

As a health-conscious consumer, I want to see a clear breakdown of ingredient benefits and the honey delivery system on the homepage, while seeing all product categories (Honeys, Tinctures, Gummies), so that I can make an informed, confident, and convenient purchase of premium wellness products.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] **Hero Evolution**: Dark, premium hero section updated to lead with the "Wild-Sourced, Scientifically Formulated" value proposition.
- [ ] **Mushroom Synergy Section**: Dedicated breakdown for Lion's Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps with stylized UI displaying scientific benefits.
- [ ] **The Honey Matrix**: Information section explaining the biological delivery benefits of the honey base.
- [ ] **Category Showcase**: Interactive section for "Honeys", "Tinctures", and "Gummies" categories (filtered by tags/types since not in Shopify Collections).
- [ ] **Strategic Conversion**: All products visible/accessible on the homepage with clear "Shop Now" CTAs.
- [ ] **Lux-Noir UI**: Implementation follows the premium dark aesthetic defined in the Product Guidelines.

## Dependencies

- **Filtering Logic**: Since categories are not set up in Shopify Admin, we must implement client-side or query-level filtering based on product tags or types (Honeys, Tinctures, Gummies).

## Out of Scope

- Modifications to the checkout/cart flow.
- Redesigning the site-wide Footer.
- Updates to the Product Detail Pages (PDP) themselves (unless links are broken).
- Modifying the existing Quiz functionality.

## Technical Notes

- Use Framer Motion (if available) or CSS Transitions for the "Lux-Noir" micro-interactions.
- Leverage the existing `ProductItem` and `Hero` components where possible, but extend them for the new layout.
