## Overview

We will restructure the homepage from a single product feed into a tiered narrative: High-impact Hero -> Ingredient Benefits -> The Honey Delivery System -> Categorized Shopping (Honeys, Tinctures, Gummies).

## Phase 1: Foundation & Data [x]
Setup the filtering logic to properly categorize products without Shopify Collections.

### Tasks
- [x] Task 1.1: Identify product tags/types for "Honeys", "Tinctures", and "Gummies" in the Storefront API response.
- [x] Task 1.2: Update the homepage loader to fetch all relevant product data and apply the filtering logic.

### Verification
- [ ] Verify that arrays for each category are correctly populated from the API.

## Phase 2: Ingredient Synergy & Delivery Matrix [x]
Build the benefit-driven storytelling sections.

### Tasks
- [x] Task 2.1: Implement the "Mushroom Synergy" section with high-fidelity cards for Lion's Mane, Reishi, and Cordyceps.
- [x] Task 2.2: Implement the "Honey Matrix" section explaining the delivery system benefits.
- [x] Task 2.3: Apply "Lux-Noir" styling (dark gradients, premium typography) to these new sections.

### Verification
- [ ] Visual inspection of sections on mobile and desktop.
- [ ] Content accuracy check against scientific benefit profiles.

## Phase 3: Category Showcase & Conversion [x]
Build the interactive product grid for the three core categories.

### Tasks
- [x] Task 3.1: Create a 3-column / Grid "Category Showcase" for Honeys, Tinctures, and Gummies.
- [x] Task 3.2: Implement "Shop All" fallback or secondary grid to ensure all products are visible.
- [x] Task 3.3: Update Hero section CTAs to point to specific sections/categories.

### Verification
- [ ] Click-through tests for all product links and CTAs.
- [ ] Responsive behavior check for the 3-category grid.

## Final Verification [~]
Check the overall flow and "Lux-Noir" consistency.
- [ ] All 3 categories (Honeys, Tinctures, Gummies) are visible and shoppable.
- [ ] Ingredient benefits are clearly communicated with premium styling.
- [ ] Total conversion paths are intuitive (minimal clicks to product).
- [ ] "Lux-Noir" aesthetic is consistent throughout the page.
